        Snow is precipitation in the form of ice crystals. It originates in clouds when temperatures are below the freezing point (0 degrees Celsius, or 32 degrees Fahrenheit), when water vapor in the atmosphere condenses directly into ice without going through the liquid stage.
        What are the 3 types of ice?
There are three types of structural icing: clear, rime, and mixed. In most cases, the type of structural ice is most dependent on the air temperature. However, the likelihood of clear ice increases with droplet size. Clear ice typically forms when temperatures are around 2 ° C. to -10° C.
Although snowstorms typically occur in the winter, and thunderstorms typically occur during the summer, there are rare instances when meteorological conditions produce a phenomenon called thunder snow.
This snow isn't white – it's blood red. The peculiar phenomenon – sometimes known as blood snow – is the result of a defence mechanism produced by microscopic algae that grow in the Alpine snow.
“The good news is that most snow research indicates that snow is still safe to eat in moderation,” according to thekitchn.com. “Our very favorite way to do so? Snow ice cream, of course.
Additionally, snow regularly falls in the Atlas Mountains in the Maghreb. Snowfall is also a regular occurrence at Mount Kenya and Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. There have been permanent glaciers on the Rwenzori Mountains, on the border of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
